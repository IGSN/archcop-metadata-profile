The Archaeological Sample Metadata Profile has been developed by the [IGSN–DataCite Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Community of Practice](https://ev.igsn.org/communities/archaeology) (‘Archaeology CoP’). It aims to standardize the description of archaeological and cultural heritage samples, taking in account disciplinary-specific use cases and workflows.

# The IGSN–DataCite Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Community of Practice

The Archaeology CoP has been meeting monthly since March 2022. It is composed of a small group of archaeologists and cultural heritage researchers with backgrounds in areas such as archaeometry, landscape archaeology, and data management from prehistoric to modern eras, and with an interest in material sample management, data collection, and publication.
