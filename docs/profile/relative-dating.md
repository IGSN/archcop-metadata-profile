# 19.1 datingClassification

**Obligation:** Mandatory

**Definition:**<br>
The vocabulary used for the relative dating method. Mandatory if relativeDating is included. Should contain at least one, and ideally all, of the following:

<ol type="a">
  <li>The name of the standard vocabulary being used for relativeDating</li>
  <li>The URI of the standard vocabulary being used</li>
  <li>The URI of the exact term used in relativeDating</li>
  <li>The classification code (if one exists) of the exact term used in relativeDating</li>
</ol>

Note that a&b and c&d are normally pair values, so it is encouraged to include both where possible. For machine readability, and if you are using a FAIR vocabulary, it is recommended to include the URI values, with c, being optimal.
